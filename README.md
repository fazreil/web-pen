# Introduction

This project is created to showcase web testing, especially the front-end of the web. We are going to use NIKTO2 tool to scan a vulnerable website, DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application).

# Running the program

The infrastructure of the project consists of the main DVWA that we are going to perform the test upon. The rest of the infrastructure are mainly going to be set up to accomodate the testing.

### Nikto as a git submodule

Nikto has been added as git submodule. Below are the two steps instructure to check out the submodule. You'll need to bring the submodule code before proceeding to build its docker image.

Below is a set of command to initiate and load nikto as a submodule:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

#### Understanding git submodule

Git submodule is another git repository residing in the git repository. Although the practise is not recommended due to the design of git to be all inclusive, there are scenarios where including other repositories within cannot be avoided.

#### Updating NIKTO source code
Updating NIKTO source code to get the latest from NIKTO's repository
```
git submodule foreach "git fetch origin"
git submodule foreach "git pull origin master"
```

# Build nikto image

Get into nikto directory to build nikto
```
cd nikto
docker build -t sullo/nikto .
```

Run nikto docker container from the built image without arguments to display the full help
```
docker run --rm sullo/nikto
```

You can check the docker image built by listing all docker image

```
docker images
```

# Bringing up DVWA

ref: https://hub.docker.com/r/sagikazarmark/dvwa

```
$ docker pull sagikazarmark/dvwa
$ docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 sagikazarmark/dvwa --name dvwa
```

# Testing the DVWA with Nikto
Run the following command to run NIKTO while targetting DVWA
```
docker run --rm sullo/nikto -h http://dvwa
```

## Save report generated by NIKTO
To save the report in a specific format, mount /tmp as a volume:
```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp sullo/nikto -h http://dvwa -o /tmp/out.json
```
